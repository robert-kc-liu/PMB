PMB
===

PMB or Performance Monitoring Beeper is a program that helps you monitor critical high CPU or memory usage and notify you with beeping sounds!

A beeping sound on a computer can be the most effective way to know the health of the system. Two most critical measures are considered now: high CPU and/or memory usage.

There are two monitoring strategies that be in use: instant or sustained. Instant means the as soon as the configured threshold has been exceeded, the system will beep.

Sustained means after 60 seconds of continuous high CPU or memory, the system then beeps.

All configurable parameters are found in the app.config file. Also, as this is a TopShelf program, the PMB can be installed as a Windows service to help you monitor each system as it starts up.
